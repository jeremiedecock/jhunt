Viewing documentation using IPython
-----------------------------------
To see which functions are available in `pywi`, type ``pywi.<TAB>`` (where
``<TAB>`` refers to the TAB key), or use ``pywi.*transform*?<ENTER>`` (where
``<ENTER>`` refers to the ENTER key) to narrow down the list.  To view the
docstring for a function, use ``pywi.transform?<ENTER>`` (to view the
docstring) and ``pywi.transform??<ENTER>`` (to view the source code).
